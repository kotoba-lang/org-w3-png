(ns png.encode
  "PNG encode — the direction `png.core` did not go.

  The decoder has been here since the `kasane` extraction; nothing could
  write one. That asymmetry is only visible when something already holds
  pixels and needs a browser to show them: a PDF image XObject decodes to raw
  samples, and raw samples are not a picture anyone can display.

  ## Scope, and why it is this shape

  Bit depth 8, colour types gray / gray-alpha / rgb / rgba, no interlace, one
  `IDAT`. That is exactly what `png.core/parse` can read back — R0 there does
  not unfilter sub-byte depths or Adam7 — so the pair round-trips, and a
  writer that emitted something its own reader could not take would be a
  writer nobody could check.

  16-bit is refused rather than truncated: halving the depth of somebody's
  scan silently is a worse answer than saying no.

  ## Filtering

  Every scanline is written with filter type 0 (None).

  Choosing per-line filters is what makes PNG small, and it is deliberately
  not done here: the heuristic worth having (minimum sum of absolute
  differences) needs all five candidate lines computed per row, and this
  exists to get pixels onto a screen rather than to compete with a real
  encoder. `deflate` still compresses the result. If size becomes the
  problem, that is a measurement to make before writing the heuristic, not
  after."

  Iterating a string gives Characters on the JVM and one-character strings in

  \"IHDR\" and ClojureScript wrote four zero bytes. Nothing said so: the file
  still had a plausible length, a correct CRC over the zeroed type, and a
  signature, so it failed later, in the reader, as a truncated chunk. The
  reader half of this repo is portable and the tests were JVM-only, which is
  the only reason it could stay that way. `deflate.gzip` already carried the

  "`pixels` to PNG bytes.

  `pixels` is a flat sequence of samples in row-major order — the shape
  `png.core/parse` returns, so a decode/encode round trip needs no
  rearranging. `{:width :height :color}` says how to read it; `:color` is one
  of `:gray :gray-alpha :rgb :rgba`.

  The sample count is checked against the geometry and a mismatch throws.
  Padding or truncating would produce a file that opens and is wrong — the
  image skewed diagonally, which is what a row-length error always looks
  like and never says."
