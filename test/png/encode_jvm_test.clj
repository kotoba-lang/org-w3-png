  "The oracle that needs a JVM: `javax.imageio` reading what `png.encode`
  wrote. This is the check a self-consistent reader/writer pair cannot make
  for itself -- if the CRC, the zlib wrapper or the IHDR were wrong in a way
  both halves of this repository shared, this is what would say so.

  Everything that does not need a JVM is in `png.encode-test`, which is
  `.cljc` and runs on both runtimes. Keeping these apart is not tidiness: an
  assertion parked in a `.clj` file is an assertion ClojureScript never makes,
  and that is how the chunk-type bug survived."
